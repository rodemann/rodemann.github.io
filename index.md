Hi and welcome to my personal website! 

I am a 2nd year PhD Candidate supervised by [Thomas Augustin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=3N20m1kAAAAJ&hl=de) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) Munich. My [research](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/research/) focuses on adaptive machine learing. I use imprecise probabilities to render such methods more reliable and trust-worthy. 


I am also [teaching](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/) serveral undergradute and graduate classes at our department.

Parts of this website are still under construction. Stay tuned.
