Hi there! :wave: <br>


I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate supervised by [Thomas Augustin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=3N20m1kAAAAJ&hl=de) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) Munich. My [research](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/research/) revolves around adaptive machine learing and online learning. I try to render such methods more reliable by representing the involved uncertainties. 

My position is partly funded by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany within the co-operation project "Machine Learning in Official Statistics" and I am part of the [the Graduate Center of the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt)](https://en.bidt.digital/person/julian-rodemann) within the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (BAS).

I am also [teaching](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/) several undergraduate and graduate classes at our department. Besides, I am doing [academic student counselling](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/studium/beratung/index.html) for our Bachelor "Statistics and Data Science".

Potential Topics for Bachelor/Master Theses under my co-supervision: 

* De-biased Boosting from Complex Samples
* Survey on Continual Learning (Literature research) 
* Bayesian Optimization - a Decision-Theoretic Perspective
* Lipschitz-Regularization in Deep Learning
* Horvitz-Thompson Estimation from Bayes-optimal Data 

If you are interested in one of those topics, please reach out an I will provide you with literature.
