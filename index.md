Hi there! :wave: <br>


I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate supervised by [Thomas Augustin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=3N20m1kAAAAJ&hl=de) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) Munich. I am currently at the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, working with [James Bailie](https://jameshbailie.github.io/) under the supervision of [Xiao-Li Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng). If you're in the area and would like to meet, do not hesitate to reach out!

My [research](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/research/) revolves around optimization, adaptive machine learning and online learning. I try to render such methods more reliable by representing the involved uncertainties, heavily relying on [imprecise probabilities](https://sipta.org/). 

My position is partly funded by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany within the co-operation project "Machine Learning in Official Statistics" and I am part of the [the Graduate Center of the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt)](https://en.bidt.digital/person/julian-rodemann) within the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (BAS).

I also [teach](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/) several (under)graduate classes at our department and co-supervise bachelor and master theses. Potential thesis topics under my supervision can be found [here](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/). Besides, I do [academic student counselling](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/studium/beratung/index.html) for our Bachelor program "Statistics and Data Science".
