Hi and welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD Candidate supervised by Thomas Augustin at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) Munich. My [research](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/research/) focuses on adaptive machine learing. I use imprecise probabilities to render such methods more reliable and trust-worthy. 

Besides, I am [teaching] serveral undergradute and graduate course at our department.

Parts of this website are currently still under construction. Stay tuned.
