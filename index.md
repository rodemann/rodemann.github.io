Hi there! :wave: <br>


I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate supervised by [Thomas Augustin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=3N20m1kAAAAJ&hl=de) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t (LMU) Munich. I am currently [at the Department of Statistics at Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/julian-rodemann-0), working with [James Bailie](https://jameshbailie.github.io/) under the supervision of [Xiao-Li Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng). If you're in the area and would like to meet, do not hesitate [to reach out](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/julian-rodemann-0)!

My [research](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/research/) revolves around optimization, online learning, and decision theory. I try to render such methods more reliable by representing the involved uncertainties, heavily relying on [imprecise probabilities](https://sipta.org/). I am also interested in interpretable machine learning and anything Bayesian. My research has been published in Q1 journals (Machine Learning, Knowledge-Based Systems) and accepted at A*/A conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, UAI, EMNLP).

I enjoy teaching a lot and [teach several (under)graduate classes](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/) at our department and co-supervise bachelor and master theses. Potential thesis topics under my supervision can be found [here](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/). Besides, I do academic student counselling in our Bachelor's program "Statistics and Data Science".  

I am part of the [the Graduate Center of the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt)](https://en.bidt.digital/person/julian-rodemann) within the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (BAS). The graduate center is a great place to learn about the many aspects of a digital world that are beyond my own research on machine learning and statistics/data science.
