Hi there! :wave: <br>


I am a final year PhD Candidate supervised by [Professor Thomas Augustin](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=3N20m1kAAAAJ&hl=de){:target="_blank"} at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich. 

My [research](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/research/) revolves around optimization, online learning, and decision theory. I try to render such methods more reliable by representing the involved uncertainties, heavily relying on [imprecise probabilities](https://sipta.org/). I am also interested in interpretable machine learning and anything Bayesian. My research has been published in Q1 journals (Machine Learning, Knowledge-Based Systems) and A*/A conferences (2x NeurIPS, ICLR, 2x UAI, EMNLP, ECML-PKDD).

I enjoy teaching a lot and [teach several (under)graduate classes](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/) at our department. I also (co-)supervise bachelor and master theses. Potential thesis topics under my supervision can be found [here](https://rodemann.github.io/_pages/teaching/). 

I am part of the [the Graduate Center of the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt)](https://en.bidt.digital/person/julian-rodemann) within the Bavarian Academy of Sciences (BAS). The graduate center is a great place to learn about the many facets of the digital world that are beyond my own research. Moreover, I am supported by the mentoring program of the Faculty of Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics at LMU Munich. My mentor is [Professor Konstantinos Panagiotou](https://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~kpanagio/). Parts of my research are further funded by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany within the cooperation project “Machine Learning in Official Statistics”.
