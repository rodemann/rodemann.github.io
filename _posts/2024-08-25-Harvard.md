I am spending this fall (Sept through Nov) at Harvard University in Cambridge (MA, USA) to work with [James Bailie](https://jameshbailie.github.io/) and [Xiao-Li Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng). We will investigate deep connections between online/adaptive learning and imprecise probabilities. Feel free to get in touch in case you are in the area!
