I am spending this fall at Harvard University in Cambridge (MA, USA) to work with [James Bailie](https://jameshbailie.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [Xiao-Li Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng){:target="_blank"}. We will investigate connections between online learning, privacy and imprecise probabilities. My research stay is generously supported by the German Academic Exchange Service DAAD. Feel free to get in touch in case you are in the area!
