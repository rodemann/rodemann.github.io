title:  "Research Stay at Harvard University :us: "

I am spending this fall (Sept through Nov) at Harvard University in Cambridge (MA, USA) to work with [James Bailie](https://jameshbailie.github.io/) and [Xiao-Li Meng](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/people/xiao-li-meng). We will investigate connections between online/adaptive learning and imprecise probabilities. My research stay is generously supported by the German Academic Exchange Service DAAD. Feel free to get in touch in case you are in the area!
