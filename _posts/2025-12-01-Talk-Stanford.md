I am visiting the [Stanford Trustworthy AI Research Lab (STAIR)](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I'll present our work on [empirical alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14581) and incentive-aware AI regulation -- both motivated from a statistical perspective on alignment and regulation. Drop me a message if you're in the Bay Area and would like to attend and/or meet up afterwards!
