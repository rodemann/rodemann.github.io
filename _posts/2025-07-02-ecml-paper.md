---


Happy to share that our collaboration with the Harvard SEAS Biodesign Lab has come to a successful end! Our paper ["Explaining Bayesian Optimization by Shapley Values Facilitates Human-AI Collaboration"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04629) has been accepted to ECML-PKDD (Europe's flagship conference on Machine Learning)! 

Great collaboration with Federico Croppi, Philipp Arens, Yusuf Sale, Julia Herbinger, Bernd Bischl, Eyke HÃ¼llermeier, Thomas Augustin, Conor J. Walsh, Giuseppe Casalicchio. I will link the paper here once the camera-ready version is available.
