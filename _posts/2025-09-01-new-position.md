Happy to share that today's my first day at the Rational Intelligence (RI) Lab at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. The lab is led by Krikamol Muandet and dedicated to understanding the underlying principles that enable autonomous agents to acquire knowledge effectively from their experiences. I'm looking forward to this exciting new chapter ahead!
