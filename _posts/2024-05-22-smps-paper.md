Our paper "Semi-Supervised Learning guided by the Generalized Bayes Rule under Soft Revision" has been accepted at the 11th International Conference on Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics (SMPS). Great collaboration with Stefan Dietrich (first author) and Christoph Jansen! I will link the paper here once the camera-ready version is available.
