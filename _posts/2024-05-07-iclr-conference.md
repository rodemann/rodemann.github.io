I will attend ICLR 2024 to present [our paper "Partial Rankings of Optimizers"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=mhwNoQcEjQ), which has been accepted at the ICLR 2024 Tiny Papers Track. Great collaboration with Hannah Blocher (equal contribution)! Let me know if you're also at ICLR in Vienna and would like to meet up. Looking forward to exchange ideas and laughther!
