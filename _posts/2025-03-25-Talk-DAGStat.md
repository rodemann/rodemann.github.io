I'm giving a talk at [DAGStat](https://dagstat2025.de/#conference-program){:target="_blank"}, one of Germany's major conferences on Statistics. I'll present our paper on [reciprocal learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/0337b41b4e8b2eb5d7ab161ffd42cf3b-Abstract-Conference.html){:target="_blank"} on March 27 in session 21. Let me know if you're at DAGStat and would like to meet up!
