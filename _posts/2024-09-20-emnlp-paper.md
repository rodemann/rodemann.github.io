Happy to share that our paper "Adaptive Contrastive Search: Uncertainty-Guided Decoding for Open-Ended Text Generation" has been accepted for EMNLP 2024 Findings! Great collaboration with Esteban Garces Arias, Meimingwei Li, Matthias AÃŸenmacher, and Christian Heumann. I will link the paper here once the camera-ready version is available.
