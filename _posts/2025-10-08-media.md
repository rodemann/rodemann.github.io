Our research on personalizing exosuits via interpretable Bayesian optimization was covered by Börsen-Zeitung, Germany's main newspaper on financial markets. 

I was interviewed on our paper [“Explaining Bayesian Optimization by Shapley Values Facilitates Human-AI Collaboration For Exosuit Personalization” (ECML)](https://ecmlpkdd-storage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/preprints/2025/ads/preprint_ecml_pkdd_2025_ads_181.pdf).
