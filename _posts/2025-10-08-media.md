Our research on personalizing exosuits via interpretable Bayesian optimization was covered by Börsen-Zeitung, Germany's main newspaper on financial markets.

Specifically, I was interviewed on our paper [“Explaining Bayesian Optimization by Shapley Values Facilitates Human-AI Collaboration For Exosuit Personalization” (ECML)](https://ecmlpkdd-storage.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/preprints/2025/ads/preprint_ecml_pkdd_2025_ads_181.pdf). 

[The article](https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/meinung-analyse/milliardenmarkt-fuer-exosuits-reift-heran) (paywall) discusses the growing market of exosuits and exoskeletons and the importance of personalizing such wearable devices -- oftern via Bayesian optimization (BO). This is where our research comes into play: By interpreting BO, taking into account its uncertainty, we allow users to interact with the BO system in a more efficient way. Human-AI collaboration at its best! :rocket:
