Great news! Our paper "Imprecise Bayesian Optimization" has been accepted for publication in [Knowledge-based Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/knowledge-based-systems)! This is joint work with my supervisor Thomas Augustin. I will link the paper here once the camera-ready version is available.
