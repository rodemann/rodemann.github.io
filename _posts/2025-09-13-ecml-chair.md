title:  "Chairing Two Sessions at ECML-PKDD 2025 in Porto"
---

I'm on my way to Porto to attend the European Conference on Machine Learning ECML-PKDD (Europe’s flagship conference on Machine Learning) in order to present our paper “Explaining Bayesian Optimization by Shapley Values Facilitates Human-AI Collaboration For Exosuit Personalization”.

As I just found out, I was nominated as session chair for two sessions (Learning Theory and Optimization). This will be the first time for me to chair a session at a major ML conference, so I'm pretty excited!
