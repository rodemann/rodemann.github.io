title:  "Two papers accepted at NeurIPs :champagne: :champagne:"
---


Pretty excited that both of my first-ever NeurIPs submissions got accepted, one of which as spotlight! This was a great team effort by Christoph Jansen, Georg Schollmeyer, Hannah Blocher, and my supervisor Thomas Augustin. The papers are ["Reciprocal Learning"](https://x.com/StatMLPapers/status/1823208851836964935) and [Statistical Multicriteria Benchmarking via the GSD-Front](https://mobile.x.com/StatMLPapers/status/1798928907380437375).
