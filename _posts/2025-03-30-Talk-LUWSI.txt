I'm presenting some work in progress at [LUWSI](https://fm.ls/luwsi2025), the 2nd edition of the workshop on Learning Under Weakly Structured Information (LUWSI) in Tübingen. Extremely excited about meeting researcher from different fields working on theoretical machine learning, decision theory and statistics!
