Thrilled to annouce that our papers "Approximately Bayes-Optimal Pseudo-Label Selection" and "Robust Statistical Comparison of Random Variables with Locally Varying Scale of Measurement" were accepted for the 39th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI). Looking forward to present them at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh this August!
