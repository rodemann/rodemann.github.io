Thrilled to annouce that our papers ["Approximately Bayes-Optimal Pseudo-Label Selection"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/rodemann23a) and ["Robust Statistical Comparison of Random Variables with Locally Varying Scale of Measurement"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/jansen23a.html) were accepted for the 39th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI). Looking forward to present them at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh this August!
