Thanks for your interest in my research. 

I am a statistician working on reliable machine learning. In particular, I try to incorporate epistemic modeling uncertainty into adaptive machine learning methods such as self-training, superset learning or Bayesian optimization. To this end, I mainly rely on ideas from the realm of imprecise probabilities.   

## Research Interests

* All things Bayesian
* Imprecise Probabilities
    * Generalized Bayes
    * Imprecise Gaussian Processes
    * Neighborhood Models
* Robust Surrogates in Bayesian Optimization
* Superset Learning/Inference
* Weak Supervision
